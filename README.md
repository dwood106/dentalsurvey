first time doing this on my own

Overview:
This was my first time truly doing a website on my own. I did refer to my notes quite a bit, and I can see the imperfections in it. However, it is something that I am proud of at this step.
I do plan on researching and going back to fix the imperfections. 
A week ago I could not wrap my head around how to do this, and here I've actually got something to show for my dedication. 
I first focused mainly on the html and completed that section, then I played around with the CSS. 
As I said there was quite a bit of googling involved, but from what I hear, that is part of the job no matter how long you have been doing it.
